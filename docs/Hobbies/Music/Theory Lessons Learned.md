## Pentatonic Scales


|Major Pentatonic|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Formula | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 6 |
| Interval | W | W | W+H | W | W+H |


|Minor Pentatonic|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Formula | 1 | \#2/b3 | 4 | 5 | \#6/b7 |
| Interval | W+H | W | W | W+H | W |

The intervals can be thought of as being shifted forward major to minor by 1 interval, and minor to major by 4, or backwards from minor to major by 1, and backwards from major to minor by 4

Relative Minor is the 6th of the Major.

## Octaves

Octaves are nice and symmetrical

Below the B string (3rd tuning divide), octave forward is 2 up 2 over, backward is 3 up 3 over.

| String | x | x | x | x | x | x | x | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| E | | | | x | | | |
| B | | | | | | | |
| G | x | | | | | | |
| D | | | | | | x | |
| A | | | | | | | |
| E | | | | x | | | |

| String | x | x | x | x | x | x | x |

| String | x | x | x | x | x | x | x |

## Chord Progressions

Chord progression notation is with uppercase and lowercase roman numerals. Uppercase indicates major, lowercase indicates minor.

The chord format for the Major key is I-ii-iii-IV-V-vi-vii*
For C Major this would be C Major,  D Minor, E Minor, F Major, G Major, A minor, B Diminished

The chord format for the Minor key is i-ii*-III-iv-v-VI-VII

For A minor this would be A minor, B diminished, C major, D minor, e minor, F Major, G Major

Apparently, This format is ALWAYS the same for major and minor keys.

It should follow then that for any modes of the standard western heptatonic scale, that since the intervals are the same just at different starting points, these should work for any modality.
