### This is the first guitar cover that I've done by ear.
Aegaeon is a cool little known deathcore band from Evansville, Indiana. This song is one of my favorites from their Being EP, but tabs for it are nonexistent. It felt within my skill range to play so I decided to take a swing at learning it by ear. There was one other cover on youtube that covered parts of the main verse and chorus, but nothing for the solo at the end and some sections. 

I also was playing around with Adobe Vegas and so this cover is mostly me trying out different angles (some of which aren't great in hindsight). I'm currently working on a tab to distribute for anyone that wants to learn it.
