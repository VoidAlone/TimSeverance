Questions 1-6 from the Test 3 sample are very close to questions that will be on the test.

Be aware of the Extended Euclid's Algorithm. You will be asked to find s and t.

- Modding negative numbers
- Congruency (6.2 definition: m divides (x-y))
- Prime Factorization (gcd, lcd)
- Decimal to Binary
- Base conversions (octal, hex, etc.)
- Modding LARGE values (remember the way exponents work to simplify the problem, and use 6.2.(2/4) for the equation for modular arithmetic)
### Chapter 7 Topics

Remember that in a sequence, the next value can be determined by multiplying the previous value by the common ratio. What this also means is that we can express all values in a sequence as being the initial value times the common ratio raised to an index. Additionally, the sum of all values can be expressed as common ratio raise to the power of n+1, minus 1.

7.3

PA 7.10.4.1 will be on the exam

Questions about Common ratio, balanced strings, calls in a binary search, recursive definition with strings, sum questions.
### Chapter 8 Topics

Exercise 8.4.4 is featured on the exam.

Binary Strings, and sequence of characters where there are no repeated neighbors.

8.8 is useful.

### Written Response Questions

Section 2 in the test exam has questions (22-25) that are very close to the exam. 

Be comfy with the strong induction example with money. 

Strong induction for proving a sum is equal to a closed form equation. 

Evaluate a Sum for some large number of iterations (7.3 has formulas for closed forms). 

Euclids Algorithm to find GCD and s and t (Extended Algorith, remember, you're just working out the standard algorithm to completion, then backtracking by substituting numbers with expanded forms. See the discord explanation in homework help). 

One question similar to Test 3 Sample Question 25 about cards.
