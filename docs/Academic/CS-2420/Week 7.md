### Study Guide
##### Data Structures
-What are ADTs and why do we use them?
-Why do we care about abstraction

##### Big O
11ish questions
-best, average, worst case
-constant time operations (one tricky question)
-composite runtime + bigO

##### Searches

##### Sorts
-Insertion Sort
	swaps
	outer loop (how many times)
	runtime

-Merge Sort
	runtime

-Quick Sort
	runtime

-Selection Sort
	runtime
	order

##### Linked List
-How to insert into a singly linked list
-Reversal
-What are nodes, and what do they do / contain
-how to traverse


##### Stacks
3 Questions on infix/postfix
-Infix 
	Evaluation
	Conversion to Postfix
	
-Postfix
	Evaluation
	Conversion to Infix
	
-Push
	If you're adding to a stack, you're putting it on top
	
-Pop
	If you're taking something off the stack, you're taking it off the top
	
-Peek
	returns the top item without removing it

##### Queues
-Enqueue
	If you're entering a queue, you're entering the back of the line
	
-Dequeue
	If you're leaving the queue, you're leaving from the front of the line

##### Deques
-A queue that can push and pop from both ends

##### Dynamic Array
-Allocation?
-Append?
