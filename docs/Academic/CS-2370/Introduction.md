### Introduction to C++ Programming

C++ is generally considered to be hard.

Reasons why it's hard (it's not pointers)
- C++ is hard because it has lots of semantics
- C++ is hard because it often has complex compiler errors and linker errors
- C++ is hard because it has fine-grain control and is very expressive
- C++ is hard because it let's you do a lot, including blasting your own leg off (foot guns)
- C++ is hard because it is designed to be backwards compatible. Many people teach C++ as C with new features. 

NOTE: Semantics are crucial, but often debated. When we use certain words, we assign certain meaning to those words, and people spend a lot of time debating on whether or not the exact words and what they mean are correct. Don't worry too much about getting lost in the weeds of semantics, just be willing to change and adapt your understanding to match better, more informed definitions.

### Class Structure
- We'll have a class-topics thread in discord. This is where you all will post questions that you have or material you especially want to talk about in class.
- I don't really go over slides. We'll talk about relevant class material, and any side topics that you all want covered. 
- Since this course has biweekly modules, we'll generally talk about relevant material for the first week, and then cover projects and labs in the second week.

### Warnings
- I do not make the coursework. I am an adjunct, not a mentor. Let me repeat that, I don't make the coursework, or any of the material. I'm here to deliver it to you, help you understand it, and guide you through the work. Someone had the audacity to complain about the fact that I didn't create my own material when I explained that day 1 a few semesters ago. I'm also not in control of zybooks. If there are issues, it's an administrative issue that comes from zybooks or the department. All I can do to fix things is send emails and hope people respond quickly. So let it be written, that I don't make the material.
- If attendance gets too low, I will enforce an attendance policy. I hate basing grades off attendance, but the overall class experience diminishes greatly if people aren't coming to class. Class is better with you there. 

### Success
- Get your sleep. Seriously, this is probably the most important thing. Staying awake burning the midnight oil might feel like what you're supposed to do, and with how fast things go, you might have to stay up a bit. But seriously, get your 8 hours, make sure you're rested. Take mental breaks. Come back to it if it's not clicking. If it comes down to you not sleeping so that you can get your project in on time, let me know, get your rest, and I'll flex the date by a day.
- Read. The CS major is really a reading and writing major. While we generally write lots of programs in this major, more than anything, what you're doing is communication. This means, read the documentation, ACTUALLY read your errors that you get in the terminal, etc.
- Get used to drawing/writing. Honestly, the easiest way to grasp material in this class is often to draw things out and walk through problem steps on paper, whiteboard, onenote, whatever.
- Group up. We don't tolerate plagiarism. But we do love it when students get together, explain topics to each other, suggest strategies for approaching a problem, help each other succeed, and make friends. 
- Have fun. Realize that although this course will be challenging, this is a real meat and potatoes course. This is one of the true CS classes that you'll take, with topics that'll be useful to you whether you're building compilers, working with assemblers, or writing DSL's. Look ahead to the future, and get pumped for the cool stuff you'll learn!
- Get ahead of the work. Don't lose the basically free points that come from the reading. Get those in on time. Even if you need to skim ahead, get your PA points. It's the freest way to get points, which will potentially give you more wiggle room on the exams and projects. They can be the deciding factor between matriculation or not.
- Engage during class-time. I know it's tough sometimes to speak up, and sometimes there might be someone who appears to know a lot, so you don't want to embarrass yourself. It's really fine though, we're all in different places, and chances are, a lot of other people are wondering the same thing you are, and big chances are, someone may not even realize they have a question (very dangerous). So pipe up, ask questions, and be engaged. We'll have a lot better of a time if everyone has fun and talks during class!
