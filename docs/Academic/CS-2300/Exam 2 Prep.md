Adjacency Matrix

String Concatenation

Set Partitions

Floor / Ceiling Functions

Subsets

- Remember that if a set is an element of a set, the elements of that set are not elements of the main set.... A = {1, {2}} Then 2 is not an element of A, and {2} is not a subset of A. {{2}} is a subset of A.

Set builder notation:

Set Operations

- Union = Combination of elements
- Intersect = Elements that are in common
- Difference = A - B = Elements only in A
- XOR / Symmetric Difference = Elements that are not in common
- Complement = Elements outside of the set.

Strings

- 3.6 Talks about string notation

- 4.1 Talks about operations on strings

Functions:

- g: R -> R . g(x) = |x| 
	-  g maps every real number to a real number, specifically it maps all real numbers to the absolute value of itself.
- One-to-one, onto, bijection
- Well-defined: all elements have one and only one mapping.
- Identity Function (4.5)
- Inverse of Functions

Logarithms
- One question on log expressions and equivalences
