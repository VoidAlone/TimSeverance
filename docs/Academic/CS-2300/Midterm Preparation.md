The Midterm will have tables that have laws of propositional logic and rules of inference, quantifier instantiation and generalization, mathematical definitions, as well as language of proofs. 

### Midterm Multiple Choice Hints:

**A good number of questions come from chapter 1. Many require that you translate abstract language to symbolic form (a sentence to p->q for instance). Many are about logical equivalence.**

One Question with the table from 1.9. Remember the rows are x, columns are y. Hint, it's not the OR statement.

Direct Proof: Takes the form p -> c.

Remember Contrapositive: !Q -> !P or !c -> !p. Also, be sure to remember to flip the logical symbol.

Proof by exhaustion: Demonstrate with every element in the domain.

Proof by Contradiction: Assume the theorem is false, and show that in doing so, you can reach conclusions that aren't true.

Proof by Cases: Select a subset of elements in the domain. For instance, if the domain is real numbers, a case could be where all x are even numbers, and all y are odd numbers.

Logical Equivalence: Have the tables handy, but when in doubt, draw out the truth table.

One question asks about 1 of the 4 **common errors** in proofs outlined in 2.3

Nested Quantifier question. Just be sure to read it out loud. For example, UxEy P(x, y) reads For every x, there is a y where ...

Be familiar with, Inverse, Converse, Contrapositive, specifically what form they take.

There's one question with DeMorgan's Law that feels like a curve ball. Don't overthink it, your first hunch is probably right. Just apply DeMorgan's to the expression, and remember to flip all the signs after distributing the negation into the expression (as per DeMorgan's).

What is the difference between a predicate and proposition? How do we turn predicates into propositions? Or in other words, what are some ways that we turn P(x,y) into a proposition?

A few questions will have answers that look the same unless you're careful and notice their logical operators. I have a tendency to skim over equations, so be sure to read the signs.

### Midterm Written Question Hints:

Two questions will ask you to turn a sentence into its symbolic form. An important part to remember is that when talking about Nested Quantifiers, you have to account for the fact that if x and y have the same domain, you generally need to take into consideration that for whatever predicate, like x emailed y, x and y can refer to the same person or whatever thing in the domain. From 1.10, How could we use logic to express that everyone sent an email to everyone else without including the case that everyone sent an email to himself or herself? The idea is to use the conditional operation: (x ≠ y) → M(x, y).

One logic puzzle where you have to infer something. Keep in mind that the two are making contradictory statements.

One will ask you to prove that something is even. This question should be answered in the theorem format, not the symbolic format. Be familiar with the types of proofs from chapter 2.

One question will ask you to establish the validity of an argument. Convert the statements into their symbolic form, then use rules of inference to show the conclusion. Remember that an argument is a conjunction of all hypotheses that yields a conclusion. Remember that we're not replacing anything in the argument. We introduce the hypotheses in our steps table, and then use rules of inference to draw new conclusions, and ultimately end at a conclusion.
