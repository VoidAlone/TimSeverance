Logs are the result of repeated (or iterated) division

Exponents are the result of repeated multiplication

Products are the result of repeated addition

Quotients are the result of repeated subtraction

There are operations of a higher order after Logs and Exponents.

After Exponents is Tetration or super exponentiation or repeated exponentiation, and after the log is inverse tetration or super log or repeated logarithm

Logs are the result of dividing the operand k number of times by the base until we are left with 1

Kind of

So in terms of calculating the complexity of a recursive function, in the case of a binary search where we are decreasing the search space and search time by division every time, we are iteratively dividing, or performing a logarithmic search.

In terms of calculating the fibonacci sequence, we are iteratively increasing the amount of time to find the result, or performing an exponential calculation.

Repeated operations aren't real though
