### About me
- I'm 30
- Background, WV, SP-BR, BYU-I, UVU, etc.
- I play guitar, enjoyer of death metal. Fallujah, rivers of nihil, ne obliviscaris, black crown initiate, ulcerate, aegaeon, cynic, death. I like a lot of other music too though.
- I love sushi, but really any dishes with rice I usually go crazy for

- R6 Siege, Elden Ring, The Finals
- Reading, movies, hobby collection
### Class Structure
- Each week, on the first day, we'll go over the project spec together, and start to think about the problems we'll need to solve. We might look at the test cases, potential pain points, function names, etc.
- After reviewing the projects, we'll move on to the course material with the project details in mind. 
- Each day, we'll have a 10-15 minute break in the middle to stretch our legs, get a drink, catch our breath.
- If we have enough time, we'll do an in-class activity going over classic data structure / algorithm interview questions

### Warnings
- I do not make the coursework. I am an instructor, not a "course mentor". Let me repeat that, I don't make the coursework, or any of the material. I'm here to deliver it to you, help you understand it, and guide you through the work. Someone had the audacity to complain about the fact that I didn't create my own material when I explained that day 1 a few semesters ago. I'm also not in control of zybooks. If there are issues, it's an administrative issue that comes from zybooks or the department. All I can do to fix things is send emails and hope people respond quickly. So let it be written, that I don't make the material.
- I can't be your debugger. I can offer support in the way of tips and tricks to have a better debugging experience. I can guide you in terms of understanding different algorithms, and data structures, and generally what to do. What I can't do is sit down with your code and step through it and identify what's wrong for you. 
- Summer semester is FAST. I'm gonna try and ease the pain as much as I can. We might have to cram some things in here and there, but generally, I understand it's a lot to learn in a small amount of time. You all probably have other stuff going on too, so I get it. Let me know if you're struggling, and we can hash it out. 
- If attendance gets too low, I will enforce an attendance policy. I hate basing grades off attendance, but the overall class experience diminishes greatly if people aren't coming to class. Class is better with you there. 

### Success
- Get your sleep. Seriously, this is probably the most important thing. Staying awake burning the midnight oil might feel like what you're supposed to do, and with how fast things go, you might have to stay up a bit. But seriously, get your 8 hours, make sure you're rested. Take mental breaks. Come back to it if it's not clicking. If it comes down to you not sleeping so that you can get your project in on time, let me know, get your rest, and I'll flex the date.
- Read. The CS major is really a reading and writing major. Yes, we're hitting algorithms and data structures, and we're sometimes doing math adjacent things, but more than anything, what you're doing is communication.
- Get used to drawing/writing. Honestly, the easiest way to grasp material in this class is often to draw things out and walk through problem steps on paper, whiteboard, onenote, whatever.
- Group up. We don't tolerate plagiarism. But we do love it when students get together, explain topics to eachother, suggest strategies for approaching a problem, help eachother succeed, and make friends. 
- Have fun. Realize that although this course will be fast, this is a real meat and potatoes course. This is one of the true CS classes that you'll take, with topics that'll be useful to you whether you're building a compiler, implementing a social media website, or making a video game. Look ahead to the future, and get pumped for the cool stuff you'll learn!
- Get ahead of the work. Don't lose the basically free points that come from the reading. Get those in on time. Even if you need to skim ahead, get your PA points. It's the freest way to get points, which will potentially give you more wiggle room on the exams and projects. They can be the deciding factor between matriculation or not.
- Engage during class-time. I know it's tough sometimes to speak up, and sometimes there might be someone who appears to know a lot, so you don't want to embarrass yourself. It's really fine though, we're all in different places, and chances are, a lot of other people are wondering the same thing you are, and big chances are, someone may not even realize they have a question (very dangerous). So pipe up, ask questions, and be engaged. We'll have a lot better of a time if everyone has fun and talks during class!
