## Pentatonic Scales


|Major Pentatonic| | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Formula | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 6 |
| Interval | W | W | W+H | W | W+H |


|Minor Pentatonic| | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Formula | 1 | \#2/b3 | 4 | 5 | \#6/b7 |
| Interval | W+H | W | W | W+H | W |

The intervals can be thought of as being shifted forward major to minor by 1 interval, and minor to major by 4, or backwards from minor to major by 1, and backwards from major to minor by 4

Relative Minor is the 6th of the Major.

#### Some general shapes you can rely on
If you find yourself playing around a root note, there are some safe bets you can make. 

Assume you're playing on the root note of a pentatonic scale.
The term 3's indicates a whole step, 4's indicates a whole + half step.
Backwards indicates playing notes behind a root note going towards the 0th fret
Forwards indicates playing notes ahead of a root note going towards the 24th fret.

##### Minor Pentatonic

|     |     |      |
| --- | --- | ---- |
| x   |     | x    |
| x   |     | ROOT |
| x   |     | x    |
In the minor pentatonic, if you play the root, you'll find yourself in the middle of a stack of 3's playing backwards.

|  1   |   2  |   3  |   4  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| x   |     | x   |     |
| ROOT   |     |     | x   |
| x    |     |     |  x   |
In the minor pentatonic, if you play the root note, there's a 3 above, a 4 below, and a 4 on your root playing forwards.

Adjust this shape for the 3's tuning divide on the b string.

##### Major Pentatonic

This one is even easier. 

If you're playing forwards, you get a stack of 4's above, 3's below, and you play a 3 on the root.

If you're playing backwards, you get a 4 below, and a stack of 3's above, and you play a 4 on the root.

#### 2-3-2 or 3-2-3 or whatever

### Stacks along the fretboard

Pentatonically speaking, if you were to have perfect fourths tuning, and an infinite number of strings, you'd find a repeating pattern of a double stack of 4s, followed by a triple stack of 3's. The interesting part is that after every 4 stack, set of stacks shifts backwards by 1

| 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9  | 10  | 11  |  12   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   f  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|   c  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|   g  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|   d  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|   a  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|   e  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|   b  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|   g  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|   d  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
## Octaves

Octaves are nice and symmetrical

Below the B string (3rd tuning divide), octave forward is 2 up 2 over, backward is 3 up 3 over.

| String | x | x | x | x | x | x | x | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| E | | | | x | | | |
| B | | | | | | | |
| G | x | | | | | | |
| D | | | | | | x | |
| A | | | | | | | |
| E | | | | x | | | |

| String | x | x | x | x | x | x | x |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| E | | | | | | | |
| B | | x | | | | | |
| G | | | | | | x | |
| D | | | | | | | |
| A | | | | x | | | |
| E | | | | | | | |

| String | x | x | x | x | x | x | x |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Chord Progressions

Chord progression notation is with uppercase and lowercase roman numerals. Uppercase indicates major, lowercase indicates minor.

The chord format for the Major key is I-ii-iii-IV-V-vi-vii*
For C Major this would be C Major,  D Minor, E Minor, F Major, G Major, A minor, B Diminished

The chord format for the Minor key is i-ii*-III-iv-v-VI-VII

For A minor this would be A minor, B diminished, C major, D minor, e minor, F Major, G Major

Apparently, This format is ALWAYS the same for major and minor keys.

It should follow then that for any modes of the standard western heptatonic scale, that since the intervals are the same just at different starting points, these should work for any modality. 

## Circle of Fifths

![[Pasted image 20230908211202.png]]

Ordering for the Circle of Fifths is cool. Pretty much pick your starting note, say C, cut the circle in half from the line on the left. So the line should cut straight down the middle in C's case. Include the note to the left of your root.

Now, every other note (including wrapping around is the next note in scale). For C, your 2nd is D, 3rd is E, 4th is F, 5th is G, 6th is A, 7th is B. That's a given.

For the relative minor, take two notes to the right, 4 notes to the left. Every other note is still the sequential item in the sequence. Relative minor (6th) is always 3 away from your Major.
