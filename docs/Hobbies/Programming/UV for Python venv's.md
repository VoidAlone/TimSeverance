This is a little cheat sheet for uv commands

uv sync: use to "activate" an environment. This allows you to run python commands normally as opposed to having to use uv run --hello.py or whatever

uv run: execute tools and scripts

uv add: adds dependencies to a project. Alternative to pip install but also adds the library to your lock file.
