## Context

You're making a game with custom movement for things like air strafing or special movement abilities.

## Problem

Unreal Engine provides loads of great features for developers right out of the box. Features that would otherwise have to be written from scratch, and in some engines (cough cough Unity) I've found that it's quite a struggle and there's a lot of fighting to get things to work. 

One thing that Unreal provides right out of the box comes in the form of templates. FPS and TPS games are two templates that provide basic movement, camera controls, game mode, and networking. 

That being said, if you want your game to not feel generic, or in other words, to have a special feel, obviously there are some things that you'll want to tweak. Many features are very easily editable, but sometimes you might want to roll your own implementation. In my case, I specifically want to replicate certain aspects of Source or IdTech3 engines, specifically in relation to air control and the general vibe of the movement scheme.
