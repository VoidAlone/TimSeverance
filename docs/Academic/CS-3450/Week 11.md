### To-do

We're all done with homework at this point. Adapter pattern is a relatively straightforward pattern. This week we have the Iterator pattern for the upcoming project, and we have a project about the Composite pattern coming up soon as well.

We'll talk about these but we'll end up looping back and hitting the template method pattern in more detail because it's a really useful pattern.

We have a midterm this week. Will be published on Tuesday evening. Goes over most of the patterns we've covered up to the adapter (not included on this exam) as well as a few design terms.

### Iterator Pattern

At this point, whether you've known it or not, you've been interacting with iterators in just about every language you've used in your major so far. 

2420 is the first real brush with iterators that you've had though. You may not have realized it, but when implementing your linked list, you created an iterator. Check out this spec from python.

Most languages have details on implementing iterators. It's a pretty important feature when it comes to creating data structures / containers.

### Composite Pattern
