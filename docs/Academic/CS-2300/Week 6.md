### Functions

A function maps some value x to another value y. 

In algebra we use the form f(x) = y, in discrete math we use the form f: X -> Y

The set X is called the domain of f, and the set Y is the target, or co-domain, of f.

(x, y) element of f

For all elements in f, a given element in the domain of f must map to exactly one target of f to be considered well defined. If an element of the domain targets 0 or 2 or more targets, it's not well-defined.

A function is one-to-one/injective if all elements of the domain map to unique targets. Or in other words, f(x1) != f(x2). 

A function is onto/surjective if all targets are mapped to.

Bijection: If a function is one-to-one and onto

If a function is a bijection, then the inverse of f is obtained by mapping the targets to the elements of the domain.

Composition is when we apply the results of one function to another function.
