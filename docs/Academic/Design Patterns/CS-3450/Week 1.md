### Syllabus and what this class is

Principles and Patterns of Software Design. AKA, how to make your code not suck.

This class is cultural. This class is more of a reading/writing, philosophy, linguistics, architecture, history, design class than it is a "coding" class. Obviously we do a great deal of coding, but that's the hammer, not the house. 

It's meant to be experiential. Don't get me wrong, chatgpt is great for helping when it comes to implementation, don't get me wrong, but for the rest of the class, it's really about digging into the problems of software, experiencing them, getting a handle on it, and knowing when or when not to apply patterns.

OOP vs Functional

Design Patterns

What is OOP?

What are patterns?

### Take this fish and look at it

### Wheels

In school, our main goal is often to practice by reinventing the wheel. This allows us to gain exposure to solving problems and gaining the same insights that countless others before us have. However, in real life, patterns help us to avoid reinventing the wheel for every problem.

5:52 - WW2 and modern environments

12:40 - The root: A continuous moral preoccupation with under what circumstances is the environment good. 

Does that moral component exist in our software? Patterns may make a program better, but it's not the same thing. Do we go far enough so that our program or the thing that's being created is morally profound? Actually has the capacity to play a more significant role in human life? Will it make human life better? Whether or not this is obtained is questionable, but it's the intent. This is what we should try to pursue.

Does the pattern language produce a coherent environment?

17:12 Patterns are a neat format, but can lack the other dimensions. The moral element, and the ability to create a coherent structure.

### The Alcove

### Quality without a name
1.  It is the process that brings order out of nothing but ourselves. It can't be captured, only invited.
2. There's a central quality that is the root criterion of life and spirit in a person, building, or wilderness. This quality is objective and precise, but can't be named
3. The search for this quality in ourselves is the crux of our own personal story. Ie, finding ourselves.
4. Finding this quality in buildings and towns relies on finding the patterns that occur there to give it its character.
5. These patterns are interlocked in geometric patterns in a space. These patterns are the atoms and molecules of a place.
6. The patterns can be dead or alive. Patterns that are alive let our inner forces loose and set us free, while dead patterns keep us trapped, locked in inner conflict.
7. The more living patterns a space has, the more the space becomes alive. It glows and has a self sustaining fire.
8. When a building or space has this fire, it becomes a part of nature. Like ocean waves and blades of grass, its parts are governed by the endless play of repitition and variety created in the precense of the fact that all things pass. This is the quality itself.

A pattern language is a gate to the quality without a name
9. The quality in buildings cannot be made, only generated indirectly by the actions of ordinary people, in the same way a flower can't be made (this was written in the 70s)
10. People can shape buildings by using a pattern language. A pattern language can give each person the ability to create an infinite variety of new and unique buildings, in the same way regular language gives the power to create infinite and unique sentences
11. The patterns aren't confined to village and farm society. All acts of building are governed by a  pattern language. 

Everything is expressed through communication. Math is language to represent phenomena. Programming is language to instruct a machine. Natural language is how we express ourselves and convey ideas. Language is our natural interface for communication. Everything emits, and part of what makes sentience, is the ability to receive what is emitted. Language ultimately has nothing to do with this agelessness, but instead just releases what is native to us. Language helps us learn the same lessons that nature speaks to us over and over again.

Patterns can be alive or dead, and a pattern language can be shared. Since language expresses those patterns that are native to us, this means that not all patterns are good, but rather we can use the positive patterns to invite a timelessness. Alternatively, anti-patterns exist, which will ultimately result in the death of a thing.

### Loose thoughts
Heat death is the hypothetical end of the universe where there will be no thermodynamic free energy. All energy will essentially be used up. All systems will be motionless. No more interactions will occur as all sources of work are finally distributed and entropy is at its max.
