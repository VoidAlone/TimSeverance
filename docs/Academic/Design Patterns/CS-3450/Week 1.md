### Wheels
	In school, our main goal is often to practice by reinventing the wheel. This allows us to gain exposure to solving problems and gaining the same insights that countless others before us have. However, in real life, patterns help us to avoid reinventing the wheel for every problem.

### The Alcove

### Quality without a name
1.  It is the process that brings order out of nothing but ourselves. It can't be captured, only invited.
2. There's a central quality that is the root criterion of life and spirit in a person, building, or wilderness. This quality is objective and precise, but can't be named
3. The search for this quality in ourselves is the crux of our own personal story. Ie, finding ourselves.
4. Finding this quality in buildings and towns relies on finding the patterns that occur there to give it its character.
5. These patterns are interlocked in geometric patterns in a space. These patterns are the atoms and molecules of a place.
6. The patterns can be dead or alive. Patterns that are alive let our inner forces loose and set us free, while dead patterns keep us trapped, locked in inner conflict.
7. The more living patterns a space has, the more the space becomes alive. It glows and has a self sustaining fire.
8. When a building or space has this fire, it becomes a part of nature. Like ocean waves and blades of grass, its parts are governed by the endless play of repitition and variety created in the precense of the fact that all things pass. This is the quality itself.

A pattern language is a gate to the quality without a name
9. The quality in buildings cannot be made, only generated indirectly by the actions of ordinary people, in the same way a flower can't be made (this was written in the 70s)
10. People can shape buildings by using a pattern language. A pattern language can give each person the ability to create an infinite variety of new and unique buildings, in the same way regular language gives the power to create infinite and unique sentences
11. The patterns aren't confined to village and farm society. All acts of building are governed by a  pattern language. 

Everything is expressed through communication. Math is language to represent phenomena. Programming is language to instruct an automoton. Natural language is how we express ourselves and convey ideas. Language is our natural interface for communication. Everything emits, and part of what makes sentience, is the ability to receive what is emitted. Language ultimately has nothing to do with this agelessness, but instead just releases what is native to us. Language helps us learn the same lessons that nature speaks to us over and over again.

Heat death is the hypothetical end of the universe where there will be no thermodynamic free energy. All energy will essentially be used up. All systems will be motionless. No more interactions will occur as all sources of work are finally distributed and entropy is at its max.

Patterns can be alive or dead, and a pattern language can be shared. Since language expresses those patterns that are native to us, this means that not all patterns are good, but rather we can use the positive patterns to invite a timelessness. Alternatively, anti-patterns exist, which will ultimately result in the death of a thing.
