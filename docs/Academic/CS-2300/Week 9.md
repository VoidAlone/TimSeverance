Sequences are special functions that take sequential integers, indices, as the domain or input.

Geometric sequence maps those indices to a series of ratios

Arithmetic sequence involves a common difference.

m = initial index
n = final index
a_m = initial term
a_n = final term
### Recurrence Relations

Recurrence relation is when a term is defined as a function of previous terms. 

Geometric sequences rely on the previous term can 

Dynamical System is one that changes over time. Over discrete time intervals, each state is fixed during each slice. The history of the system is defined by a sequence of states.

### Sigma / Summation Notation

Expresses the sum of terms in a sequence

Don't confuse summation notation with the series itself. 

For instance, if we want to calculate the values of a gemoetric sequence where the common ratio is 1/5, we end up with {1/5, 1/25, 1/125, ...}

If we want to represent the summation of that sequence, we can do so with summation notation

Sigma notation can be viewed as calculating one final result, and can be treated as an operand in an expression. So in zybooks, when they do the expanded form, we see  sigma notation + final value of sigma calculation

closed form for arithmetic sequence is an + (d(n-1)n)/2

closed form for geometric sequence is (a(r^n - 1))/(r-1)

### Induction

#### Formal Definitions
Base Case: Establishes that a theorem is true for the first value
Inductive Step: Establishes that the theorem is true for k, which means it must be true for k+1
#### 3 Laws of Recursion
A function must call itself
A function must have a base case, or a way of stopping calling itself
A function must move towards the base case
