In trying to determine what kind of art direction I want to go for in my personal projects, I'm starting to realize that a handful of artists are responsible for a lot of the anime I grew up enjoying. So here's a list to get started.

[Yoshinori Kanada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshinori_Kanada)
Kanada is a big name in japanese animation that I wasn't really aware of until doing research, but yeah, this guy is pretty revolutionary. Key animator in my favorite Miyazaki films, and very influential in animation in Japan

[Rumikko Takahashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumiko_Takahashi)
She's responsible for Inu Yasha, Ranma 1/2, and Urusei Yatsura. 

[Yoshiyuki Sadamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshiyuki_Sadamoto)
This guy has worked on so many shows that I love. He did .hack, evangelion, and other Gainax stuff, as well as Summer Wars and I think a good number of the [Mamoru Hosoda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamoru_Hosoda) movies
