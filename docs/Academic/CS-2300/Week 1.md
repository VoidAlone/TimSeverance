## Introduction

Discrete Math is where you'll really start to get into the science aspects of computer science. It is a CS course after all.

## Notes for Module 1

Logic is formal reasoning with an emphasis on making precise statements.

Propositions are statements that are either true or false. They are the most basic element in logic.

Questions are not propositions, but propositions can be an answer to a question.

A proposition has a truth value which can be true, false, unknown, or some value in between (like an opinion)

Important variables:

Zybooks refers to p, q, r for our variables as opposed to x, y, z. It doesn't really matter but each set of mathematics has its own unique set of symbols, even if they're somewhat analogous.

### [BASIC LOGIC SYMBOLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_mathematical_symbols#:~:text=a%20category.-,Basic%20logic,-%5Bedit%5D)

#### Conjunction ( ∧ )

- Logical AND
- p ^ q can translate to (x AND y) or (x && y)

#### Disjunction ( ∨ )

- Logical OR
- Also known as Inclusive Or
- p v q can translate to (x OR y) or (x || y)

#### Exclusive Or ( ⊻ )

- The way we normally use or in English. One or the other.
- You can go to Tim's class, or you can be a loser (jk)
- Also seen as ⊕

#### Negation ( ¬ )
- Logical NOT
- Reverses the truth value of proposition
- If p is True then ¬p is False

Parenthesis, Negate, AND, OR
