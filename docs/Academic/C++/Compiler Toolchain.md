### Windows

This is less of a guide, and more of a collection of links for getting a toolchain set up for developing C++ projects on windows, without installing Visual Studio (not to be confused with VS Code)

I run MSYS2 which provides a POSIX compliant Unix-like environment for developing C++ applications and much more on windows.
