## Trees + Project

### 10/31/22 (Spooky)

#### Topics to Cover
- Whitespace + Punctuation
- Pair class
- Recursive / While traversal
	- Both need to move left or right
	- We can use assignment with recursion to traverse and keep nodes the same and change the values we're looking for
	- We can do recursion calls to move left or right and make changes once we've found the node
	- We can while until a Null Node
- What kind of tree to implement
	- Standard BST using notes from Chapter 6, and following the rebalance algorithm in the spec
	- Possibly a heap implementation from Chapter 8 using lists and still using the rebalance algorithm in the spec
