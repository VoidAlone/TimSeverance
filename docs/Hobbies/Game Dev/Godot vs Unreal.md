Since Unity decided to not just shoot itself in the foot, but all blast all of its limbs off last year with the whole licensing debacle, many people have found themselves abandoning Unity for Godot. I tried Unity in the past and while I didn't enjoy it, many people have and find themselves wondering what they'll miss or how to adapt when coming over to Godot. I personally find myself in a situation where I may have to leave Unreal for Godot, at least until Unreal receives more proper support for Linux by Epic. 

Godot as an engine has a lot of good philosophy, and great people behind it. However, coming from an engine as robust as Unreal, there are some pain points. Here, I detail pros and cons of Godot vs Unreal.

### Godot

##### Pros

1) The biggest strength of Godot is it's philosophy regarding scenes. Everything is a scene. The terminology comes from rendering, but at its core a scene is a root node with children. Everything is a node, or object, and can have children. Godot has very sound logic
2) It's lightweight / small
3) FOSS
4) I've seen some pretty games be made with it
5) Good documentation
6) Very rapid development/prototyping

##### Cons

1) No terrain editor
2) No built in IK?
3) No built in handling for large worlds?
4) No advanced input system (might not need it though)
5) Graphics aren't nearly as pretty out of the box
6) No lumen / nanite
7) Very poor built-in AI
8) Very miminal networking

### Unreal

##### Pros
1) Nanite / Lumen
2) Strong AI features
3) Terrain editor
4) Enhanced input system
5) Stronger animation system 
6) Root motion / IK
7) Lots of extensions and store
8) Huge community / lots of support
9) Free
10) Better graphics

##### Cons
1) Confusing paradigms
2) Poor documentation
3) Old/poorly maintained architecture for non-new features
4) Heavy / big storage requirements
5) Editor is cleaner
6) Has a LOT of issues in Linux
7) No probuilder type option (from Unity)
8)
