Before I get too carried away with myself, here's a link to a demonstration in reflections in sheet notation. Obviously, the same reflections will be apparent in guitar.

The gist of this is that Ioanian and Phrygian mirror eachother positionally, while Dorian mirrors itself, Mixolydian and Aeolian mirror, and Lydian and Locrian mirror. I don't know that this has much to do with anything tonally, but it could be very useful to know for being aware of positions, and memorizing scales for different modes.

Interestingly, in terms of Mirrors, if we center the modes around Dorian, rather than focusing on Ionian, we get this nice relationship. Alternatively, we can think about starting from the minor scale, and we can see the mirrored scales laid out.
