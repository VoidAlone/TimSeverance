### Terminology
Set: A collection of objects

Element: Object in a set

Roster Notation: A = {}

Cardinality: The number of items in a set

Null set / Empty set: {} A set with nothing in it. Cardinality = 0

N: Natural Numbers
Z: Integers
P: Irrational numbers
Q: Rational numbers
R: Real numbers
Superscript +/- indicates set of values that are non-zero positive or negative

Set Builder Notation: A = {x ∈ S: P(x)}. Read as follows: A is the set of all x in S, such that P(x)

Universal set: Is the set of all elements within a context

Subset ⊆: If all the elements within one set exist within another set, then those elements are within a subset of another set.

Proper Subset ⊂: Same conditions as above, but A != B
### Loose Ideas
**Subset vs Element in the context of Power Set**

The empty set is a subset of every set. 

A = { 1 }
nullset 
P(A) = { nullset, {1} }
