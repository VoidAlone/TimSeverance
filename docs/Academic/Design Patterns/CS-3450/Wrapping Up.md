Jim McCarthy (Author of Dynamics of Software Development) Quotes

**Vision**
“In my opinion, a leader’s empathetic perception of the psychological state of his or team is the beginning of what we call vision. If the leader can then resonate with the team’s complex emotional state—identify with it, articulate it, and give the whole constellation of feeling and thought a visible, concrete reality in his or her own personal voice or gesture—the boundaries among the individual team members and between the team members and the leader will collapse. A wave of unity will wash over the entire community.”

**Control**
“Before the program manager can be worth anything to the team, he or she must be thoroughly disabused of the notion that he or she has any direct control. Fortunately, in the healthy team, no one needs to take any special steps to see that this happens: the program manager’s teammates will quickly disabuse him or her of any delusions of control he or she may be harboring.”

**Authority**
“The goal as far as authority is concerned is to make every team member an authority himself or herself. You want the team to have authority, both individually and collectively. That’s where the manager’s ultimate authority comes from.”

**Honesty**
“The goal on a software development project is not to have the correct plan in advance but to make the right decisions every day as things that were unknown become known. If you’ve been pretending that you know something you don’t, you won’t be able to take advantage of the true information when it becomes known. You’ll also be left in the uncomfortable position of having been proven wrong by emergent information.”

**Integrity**
“Integrity is about truth. The only thing harder than telling the truth is knowing the truth. When all around me are confirming one another’s fantasies and magically converting wishes to reality; when I have only the vaguest sensation that something is not quite right; when conventional wisdom and group think are strangling a new, emergent reality being born in me, can I know, and tell, my truth?”

**Emotion**
“In addition to calling for an understanding of the dynamics of the technology, leadership in software development requires a high degree of sensitivity to the human nature of the enterprise, an awareness of the underlying drives and emotions that determine the team’s behavior.”

**Burn-out**
“The basic issue in developer burn-out is that the individual’s passion, essential to producing great software, has been consumed or has become misdirected or is otherwise unavailable. The role of passion in software development can’t be overstated... When the passion burns out, the compulsive interest in pouring oneself into an invisible yet coherent and dynamic stream of bits goes with it.”
