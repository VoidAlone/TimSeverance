Life of Tim
===
<!-- column_layout: [1,1] -->
<!-- column: 0 -->

I'm was born and raised in West Virginia. I'm a first generation student. 

I had zero background in CS prior to UVU minus a failed attempt at figuring out C++ as a teenager.

LDS Mission in Brazil (2013-2015)

Took the Amtrak out west to BYU-I for mechanical engineering after my mission.

I met my wife, moved down here to Utah so she could finish her degree at BYU.

I transferred to UVU and changed majors to CS. ME was not for me.
