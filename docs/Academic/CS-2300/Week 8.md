### Division Algorithm (6.1)

#### HW
6.1.1(a,d)
6.1.3(c,d)

#### Divides
x divides y (not to be confused with x divided by y)

iff x != 0 and y = kx
where k is an integer

So if we're looking at 10/2, then we get 2 divides 10, which is true because 2 != 0, and 2 * 5 = 10.

So, 10 is a multiple of 2, and 2 is a factor or divisor of 10.
#### Linear Combination


#### Division

Factor: A number that divides another number evenly

Parts of Division

Divisor = denominator = d
Dividend = numerator = n
Quotient = answer = q
Remainder = r

Fraction Form : dividend / divisor

### Modular Arithmetic (6.2)


### Prime Factorizations (6.3)

#### HW
6.3.1(a,c)
6.3.2(a,c)
#### Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (Prime Factorization)
All positive integers can be expressed as a product of prime numbers in non-decreasing order
(e.g. 120 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 5)

Prime if p > 1 and 1 and p are the only factors

Composite: An integer composed of multiple factors

Multiplicity: number of times a prime occurs in the prime factorization
#### Great Common Divisor(Denominator)
largest positive integer that is a factor for two numbers x and y

#### Least Common Multiple
If x and y are factors, what is the smallest number in common?
