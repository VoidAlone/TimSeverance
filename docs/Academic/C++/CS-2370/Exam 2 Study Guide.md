### High Level Topics

- What is abstraction?
- Static data
- Array initialization
- Public vs Private
- Encapsulation
- Namespaces

### Classes

- Member access (for stack allocated and heap allocated objects)
- Inline functions
- Constructors
	- What do they return?
	- What is their purpose?
	- What kinds of constructors are there?

- List init syntax
- Memberwise overloading vs global overloading. Know the difference in syntax, and purpose.

### Exceptions

- How do we use exceptions in our projects?
- What are the 3 main keywords of exception handling?
- 

### Streams

- How do they consume input?
- How does piping a stream to a variable work in mixed input scenarios (chars vs ints)
- What happens to whitespace?
- setfill()
- eof()
- String streams (they work the same way as standard io streams, they just work on strings rather than io)
- Passing arguments to an exectuable via cli. ./a.out param1 param2 etc

### Pointers

- What is it?
- How do we create objects with pointers?
- How do we access data with pointers?
- How do we make assignments to pointers?
- Char pointers and int pointers can be used for arrays
- Pointer arithmetic
- How do we get the object pointed to by the pointer?
- delete vs delete\[\]
- How do we avoid memory leak?
- Copy constructors (Microsoft learn and cplusplus.com have good resources on this)
- Default constructors (what can't default constructors and destructors do?)
-
