### Summary from last week

Architecture that has motives other than to give life to its inhabitants results in the kinds of architecture we've seen post WW2, whether it's the copy-paste suburbs, or communist block style housing, we see architecture that does not live and give life.

### Working out our own patterns

Find something you've found a solution to, map it out
